# üõ†Ô∏è Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

Cloud computing offers three main service models, each catering to different needs.

---

## 1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
IaaS provides the building blocks for cloud infrastructure. You rent servers, storage, and networking but manage the operating system and applications yourself.

- **Examples**: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
- **Use Case**: Hosting a custom-built app that requires full control over the operating system.

---

## 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
PaaS provides a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without managing infrastructure.

- **Examples**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku.
- **Use Case**: Building a web application quickly without worrying about server configuration.

---

## 3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
SaaS delivers fully managed software applications over the internet.

- **Examples**: Gmail, Dropbox, Salesforce.
- **Use Case**: Using email, file storage, or CRM software directly via the web.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Analogy:
Think of pizza:
1. **IaaS**: You make the pizza from scratch (you control everything).
2. **PaaS**: You get a pre-made dough and toppings, then bake it (control over part of the process).
3. **SaaS**: You order a fully cooked pizza delivered to your door (everything is managed for you).
