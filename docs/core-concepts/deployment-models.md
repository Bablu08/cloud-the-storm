# üåê Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models define how cloud services are deployed and accessed.

---

## 1. **Public Cloud**
- **Definition**: Services are offered over the internet and shared among multiple users.
- **Examples**: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
- **Pros**: Cost-effective, scalable, and easy to access.
- **Cons**: Less control over security.

---

## 2. **Private Cloud**
- **Definition**: Dedicated cloud infrastructure for a single organization.
- **Examples**: VMware, OpenStack.
- **Pros**: High control, better security.
- **Cons**: Expensive and requires maintenance.

## 3. **Hybrid Cloud**
- **Definition**: Combines public and private clouds, enabling data sharing between them.
- **Examples**: A company storing sensitive data in a private cloud but using the public cloud for scalability.
- **Pros**: Flexible and balanced approach.
- **Cons**: Can be complex to manage.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Analogy:
Think of housing:
1. **Public Cloud**: Living in an apartment (shared resources).

3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Owning a house with a shared vacation home (best of both worlds).
