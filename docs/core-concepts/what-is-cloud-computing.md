# 🌩️ What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is the delivery of computing services (like servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet (“the cloud”). It enables faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## 💡 Key Idea:
Instead of owning physical data centers or servers, you can rent access to technology resources, paying only for what you use.

---

## 🛠️ Examples:
- **Netflix**: Streams videos using AWS cloud services.
- **Google Drive**: Stores your files in the cloud.
- **Zoom**: Hosts video calls using cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🌐 Benefits:
1. **Scalability**: Resources can grow or shrink based on your needs.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model reduces upfront costs.
3. **Accessibility**: Access services anytime, anywhere via the internet.

## 🖼️ Example Analogy:
Imagine a library with thousands of books. Instead of buying every book (owning servers), you just borrow what you need (using the cloud). This saves space and money while giving you access to a vast collection.
